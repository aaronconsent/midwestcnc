"""Way-covers hub-and-spoke content for the 6 priority brands.

Same structural pattern as SPINDLE_HUB_DATA / BRAND_HUB_DATA. Per-spoke
content focuses on what's UNIQUE about way-covers work for each
series / control generation:

  - Cover style selection per series (bellows / telescoping steel / roll-up)
  - Dimensional and clearance considerations per platform
  - OEM-spec availability vs custom fabrication
  - Sealing and chip / coolant intrusion patterns per orientation
  - Pallet-changer / trunnion / multi-axis interface considerations
  - Era + parts availability per control generation (control spokes)

Voice match: measured, no hype, no claim-audit ban-list phrases.
