"""
Phase 2 — Enriched city page generator.

Reads src/data/city-research.json (Wikipedia-sourced facts per city) and
src/data/states.json (state context). Generates one /service-area/{city}-
{state}/index.html per ENRICH-marked city.

Honors the editorial constraints:
- Verifiable facts only (Wikipedia city Economy sections)
- Manufacturers named as CONTEXT, never as Midwest CNC customers
- Aaron-authorized framing constraints (e.g. North Platte rail context)
- Compressed shared scaffolding to maximize uniqueness ratio

Target per page: 600–700 visible body words, ≥60% n-gram unique vs siblings.

Skip CONSOLIDATE-marked cities entirely. Add 301 redirects in
public/_redirects pointing them to their state page.
