"""Spindle hub-and-spoke content for the 6 priority brands.

Mirrors the BRAND_HUB_DATA structure in generate_brand_pages.py but for
spindle-specific service work. Each brand has:

Our Fanuc spindle hub is organized by control + drive generation rather than machine series because that's the right diagnostic lens for Fanuc spindle service."),
            ("Which Fanuc generation do you see most often?",
             "Series 0i (specifically 0i-D and 0i-F) is by far the most common Fanuc spindle setup on Midwest shop floors. Series 16i/18i/21i is the second-most-common — many late-1990s through 2000s machines still in production with αi spindle drives. Series 30i is growing as those builds age into routine service."),
            ("Do you do board-level Fanuc spindle drive repair?",
             "Yes. Fanuc spindle service is often board-level — αi and αii drive amplifiers, encoder feedback boards, spindle control modules. We work through remanufacturing specialists on boards that have gone out of OEM supply, and through Fanuc channels for current-generation parts."),

Mid-life Series 16i/18i/21i — αi drive amplifier service, PCMCIA media migration, battery and parameter recovery. Current Series 0i and 30i — αi/αii drive service, network-based parameter backup, FOCAS integration for spindle monitoring. The diagnostic lens is the control + drive generation, not the machine.",
        "how_we_approach": "Fanuc spindle service starts with confirming the generation. From there it's a fork: legacy generations (Series 0 through Series 15) go through board-level repair or remanufacturing for the spindle drive amplifier; mid-life 16i/18i/21i is αi drive service and parts availability; current 0i and 30i is mostly software, networking, and αi/αii drive verification.",
